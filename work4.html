              <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>In the context of a fast-food restaurant's promotional strategy, data analysis is sought to determine the influence of three distinct
                   promotional approaches on the sales of a new menu item within existing offerings. The introduction of this new menu item is planned across 
                   randomly selected target markets, each employing a different promotional method. The primary objective is to ascertain the promotional 
                   approach that significantly impacts the sales of the new menu item within each target market across all weeks.</p>

              <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis involves data cleansing to eliminate null values and subsequently performing feature engineering to create a new column defining Promotion 1 as the treatment variable, while Promotion 2 and 3 as control variables.</p>
              <h3>Formulating Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>Upon observing the distribution of the available data, it appears that the three types of promotions exhibit no significant differences in their means and standard deviations, thereby suggesting a normal distribution of the data. To substantiate and reinforce the assumption of a normal distribution, a histogram plot was generated to display the distribution of the mean differences between the Treatment and Control variables. The plotted distribution confirmed that the sales' mean data for each promotion type follow a normal distribution. This finding serves as a basis for selecting the methodology to be employed in the A/B Testing process, considering options such as z-test, f-test, t-test, and ANOVA. However, given the focus of this analysis on the mean values of the two test groups, the most appropriate method to employ is the t-test.
                  <ul>In this test:
                    <li>H0 = There is no significant difference in the types of promotions affecting sales outcomes.</li>
                    <li>H1 = There is a significant difference in the types of promotions affecting sales outcomes. </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
              <h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3>
                <p>Hypothesis testing was conducted using the t-test available in the scipy library. The data was initially grouped according to the promotion types, followed by the t-test analysis.</p>
                <ul>In this test:
                  <li>Promotion 1 VS Promotion 2, resulted in a p-value below 0.05 leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis (HO) and acceptance of the alternative hypothesis (H1)</li>
                  <li>Promotion 1 VS Promotion 2, resulted in a p-value above 0.05 resulting in the acceptance of the null hypothesis (HO). </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Insight</h3>
                <p>Hence, the recommended promotions for the fast-food restaurant to maintain are Promotion 1 and/or Promotion 2 to potentially achieve optimal sales outcomes. This recommendation stems from the rejection of the null hypothesis (HO) in the t-test comparison between Promotion 1 and 2, signifying a significant difference between these promotional strategies. This divergence might arise due to variations in the range of target markets reached by each promotional method. Conversely, in the t-test between Promotion 1 and 3, the accepted null hypothesis (HO) implies no significant difference between these promotions. The preference for Promotion 1 is based on an assessment of the minimum, maximum, and mean sales values, where Promotion 1 demonstrates superior performance.</p>
                <ul>The next recommended analysis:</ul>
                <ul>Conducting a comparative analysis between Promotion 1 and Promotion 2 is pivotal to determine their distinct impacts on sales across various target market segments. This assessment gains significance, particularly when faced with financial constraints or the need to economize. Gaining insights into which promotion drives more favorable sales trends within specific market segments will be instrumental in shaping strategic decisions for business expansion. When resources are limited, directing efforts towards the more effective promotion in reaching target markets can optimize overall results. Conversely, in scenarios where financial constraints aren't a concern, deploying both promotional strategies concurrently might prove advantageous. This approach harnesses their combined potential to reach a wider spectrum of market segments, thereby augmenting the restaurant's market outreach and potential revenue avenues.
